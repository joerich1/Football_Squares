    "# Scraping NFL Boxscore Data from 1978 to 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell implements the main scraping workflow to gather NFL boxscore data for each game from 1978 to 2022. The process is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup**:\n",
    "   - A timer (`start_time`) is initialized to track the total runtime.\n",
    "   - An empty dictionary (`boxscores_dict`) is created to store raw data by year and week.\n",
    "   - An empty DataFrame (`boxscores_df`) is initialized to hold the final structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterating Over Years**:\n",
    "   - For each year in the range 1978–2022:\n",
    "     - The URL for the year’s schedule page is constructed (`url_year`).\n",
    "     - The schedule page is fetched using the `make_request` utility function.\n",
    "     - The HTML content is parsed with `BeautifulSoup`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Extracting Weekly Links**:\n",
    "   - The `extract_boxscore_links` function identifies all game links for each week.\n",
    "   - If no links are found for a week, the loop breaks early.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Processing Each Game**:\n",
    "   - For each game in a week:\n",
    "     - The boxscore URL is fetched and parsed.\n",
    "     - The game’s data is extracted using the `get_boxscore` utility function.\n",
    "     - A temporary DataFrame is created to hold the game’s data, including additional columns for the season and week.\n",
    "     - The temporary DataFrame is appended to the main DataFrame (`boxscores_df`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Tracking Progress**:\n",
    "   - After processing all weeks and games in a season, the elapsed time is printed for tracking performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Final Output**:\n",
    "   - The `head()` method is called on `boxscores_df` to display the first few rows of the compiled dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow ensures that all relevant boxscore data is collected, structured, and stored in a DataFrame for analysis."
